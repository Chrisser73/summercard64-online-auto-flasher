A fully automated Batch script to check, download, and update the latest **SummerCart64 firmware** and **sc64deployer tool** from the official GitHub repository.

## ⚙️ What does this script do?

- ✔️ Automatically detects the latest firmware release from GitHub
- ✔️ Checks if a newer version of `sc64deployer.exe` is available
- ✔️ Downloads and extracts the latest deployer if needed
- ✔️ Compares your local firmware version against the newest release
- ✔️ Downloads firmware only if an update is required
- ✔️ Flashes the firmware via `sc64deployer.exe`
- ✔️ Provides user-friendly status messages, colors, and error hints

## 🛠️ How to use

> 📌 **Before running the script**, ensure the SummerCart64 cartridge is connected!

1. Plug your **SummerCart64** into a USB port on your PC.
2. Wait until you hear the **Windows "connected" sound** confirming the USB device is recognized.
3. Double-click the file named `UPDATER.bat`.
4. Follow on-screen instructions — the script will handle the rest.

No command line knowledge required.

## Features

- **Full automation** – checks, downloads, and flashes without any manual interaction

## ⚠️ Notes & Tips

- Do **not** run multiple instances of the updater simultaneously.
- If flashing fails with a "file access denied" message, make sure no other instance of `sc64deployer.exe` or the firmware file is open.
- The script requires **Internet access** to check for the latest release on GitHub.
- **PowerShell is required**, but no admin rights are needed.
